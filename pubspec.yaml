  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/imagenes/xd.jpg
    - assets/imagenes/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Quicksand
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Quicksand.ttf
    # - family: Corbel Bold
      # fonts:
      #   - asset: assets/fonts/Corbel Bold.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
